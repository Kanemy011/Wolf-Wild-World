      <h2>Beta wolf</h2>
      <p>
        Well done! You’ve shown that you’re a knowledgeable Beta Wolf, but maybe you’ve had a few slip-ups along the way. 
        You’ve got the heart and spirit of a true wolf, but perhaps you should brush up on some wolf trivia. 
        Just think of yourself as the dependable sidekick—always ready to help the Alpha but occasionally needing a nudge in the right direction.
