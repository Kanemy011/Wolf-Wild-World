      <h2>Omega wolf</h2>
      <p>
        Oh dear! It looks like you’re the lovable Omega Wolf of the group! You may have missed most of the questions, 
        but that just means you have a great sense of humor and a willingness to learn. Every pack needs an Omega to lighten 
        the mood and keep things fun! 
        Embrace your inner goofball, and don’t be afraid to ask questions. After all, even Omega Wolves can become great pack leaders one day!
